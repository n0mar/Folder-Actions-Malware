Description: Automatic Folder Actions to check LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons to avoid malware.

## Installation

1. Download files [here](https://github.com/n0mar/FolderActionsMalware/archive/master.zip)

2. Copy all (5) files to `~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions`. That is:

Home Folder > Library > Workflows > Applications > Folder Actions > **files go here**

If folders do not exist, you must create them. Ensure correct spelling and capitalisations are used.

3. Everything else is automatic. When a new file is added into a directory listed below, you will be notified.

    /Library/LaunchAgents

    /Library/LaunchDaemons

    /System/Library/LaunchAgents

    /System/Library/LaunchDaemons

    ~/Library/LaunchAgents
