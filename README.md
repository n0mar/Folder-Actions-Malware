Description: Automatic Folder Actions to check LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons to avoid malware.

## Installation

Copy all (5) files to `~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions`. That is:

Home Folder > Library > Workflows > Applications > Folder Actions > *place files*

If folders do not exist, you must create them. Ensure correct spelling and capitalisations are used.
